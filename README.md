## Acknowledgments & Credits

QueerMapTO builds on the [**Queer Spaces database**](https://torontosocietyofarchitects.ca/toronto-queer-spaces/) created by volunteers of the **Toronto Society of Architects (TSA)**.  

This database was made possible through the efforts of countless individuals, including Janice M., Kurtis C., Joël L., Amanda E., Cherisse T., Eric W., Kate R., Rebecca P., Ryan F., Samantha B., Simon L., and Spencer L.  

It also incorporates contributions from the wider community — over one thousand people who shared their memories as part of the **2024 Pride Street Fair map**,  and the class at the **University of Waterloo School of Architecture**, who supported the digitization of these memories.  

We are deeply grateful to everyone who has helped keep Toronto’s queer spaces and histories visible and accessible.
