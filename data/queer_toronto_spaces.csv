Prior to the permanent AIDS Memorial we see today, a temporary memorial had been erected annually in the park since 1988. Dual in character, the memorial was designed as a place for ""one person to have a cry, or a thousand people to hold a demonstration."" On the more intimate scale, the memorial consists of series of triangular concrete pillars arranged along a narrow curved path, just wide enough to fit one person. On the pillars, metal name plates are engraved with the names of those who have passed away from the disease. Each year during the AIDS candlelight vigil, new names are added.

Alexander Wood Sculpture,"Corner of Church and Alexander, 62 Alexander Street","43.66370653766967, -79.38032781360594","Sculpted by Del Newbigging, this bronze statue was erected in 2005 by the City of Toronto and the Church and Wellesley Village Business Improvement Area. It depicted Alexander Wood, a Scottish merchant and magistrate who in 1810 was embroiled in an investigation that led to accusations of impropriety and rumours of homosexual activity. He fled back to Scotland to avoid prosecution, but he would return to Toronto in 1812 and purchase 50 acres of land at Carlton and Church Street. Because of this incident, some considered him an early gay figure in Toronto's history and he was chosen to commemorate the queer community in The Village. A red rose was included in the statue's lapel as a tribute to Pierre Trudeau, who as Justice Minister led the partial decriminalization of homosexuality in Canada in 1969. The statue stood on a granite base that depicted scenes of Wood's life, including a scene with an exposed buttocks--rubbing the butocks became a lucky charm for those entering The Village. The statue was taken down in 2022 by the BIA due to controversy over Wood's involvement as a founding member and treasurer of The Society for Converting and Civilizing the Indians and Propagating the Gospel Among Destitute Settlers in Upper Canada, a group that raised funds for mission schools and considered precursor of the Residential School system.",Closed,2005 - 2022,Public Art,"""The Alexander Wood Statue In Toronto’s Gay Village Has Been Destroyed.""
